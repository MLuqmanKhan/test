 <p align="justify" class="serif" >Infrarred radiation from sun is varibale throughout the day. In morning time the intensity of sunlight is lower as compared to the sunlight 
in the mid-day and the evening afternoon intensity of sunlight is  also lower than the mid-day intensity of the sunlight. due to this phenomenon, the energy
we receive from the sun varries all the day. Also clouds can suddenly effect the energy being received by our solar panels. To give an optimized solution 
to this problem, we use a technique to efficiently charge our batteries through solar panels. Maximum Power Point Tracking Technique is utilzed in our 
project to provide appropriate voltage to the battery. As in Pakistan, the environment is hot, so we decided to design an MPPT solar charge controller based
on Buck Converter. It will take input from Solar Panel and then will operate upon the input volatge and current and will give an appropriate output required
by the battery.</p><br>

 <center><h2 id="C1"><b>Description of Principle of Operations </b><h2></center>
 <p align="justify" class="serif"> Maximum power point tracking solar charge controller works on the basis of Buck/Boost converter. The circuit we chose only has the buck converter as in pakistan, most of the time
 wether is very hot which gives extra power. The charger takes input from panel which is lesser than 20 volts. Which is sensed through a voltage divider circuit developed on the input
 and gives it to an analogue pin of microcontroller. also a current sense amplifier is attached using a shunt resistor on the main input section. There is also a voltage divider circuit
 on the output section where the battery is connected. A current sense amplifier is used on the output section as well. These all values are fed to the microcontroller.
 Depending upon these values, microcontroller decides about the PWM signal fed to the Half-Bridge Mosfet Driver IC. this IC takes input as a PWM signal and switches the MOSFETs with a very high 
 speed. The Buck converter acts according to the decission made by microcontroller depending upon the input and output currents and voltages.</p>

3. <b>INA213 (Current sense amplifier):</b><br>
	 <p align="justify" class="serif"> The INA21x are voltage-output, current-shunt monitors (also called current-sense amplifiers) that are commonly used for overcurrent protection, 
precision-current measurement for system optimization, or in closed-loop feedback circuits. This series of devices can sense drops across shunts
at common-mode voltages from 0.3 V to 26 V, independent of the supply voltage. Six fixed gains are available: 50 V/V, 75 V/V, 100 V/V, 200 V/V,
500 V/V, or 1000 V/V. 
<br>
The low offset of the zero-drift architecture enables current sensing with maximum drops across the shunt as low as 10-mV full-scale.
These devices operate from a single 2.7-V to 26-V power supply, drawing a maximum of 100 uA of supply current. All versions are specified over the extended
operating temperature range (40°C to +125°C), and offered in SC70 and UQFN packages.
We have used this componant as to sense the input and output voltage/current to track the working of the MPPT.</p>

 <p align="justify" class="serif"> As we have used Atmega32U4 microcontroller, which has the support to connect a USB, so we are using Universal serial bus for the connectivity of our board with PC 
to burn the code into it. </p>
 
 <center><h2 id="C1"><b>Electrical Schematic</b> <h2></center>
 <p align="justify" class="serif"> The schematic diagram is taken from the Eagle file we have developed for our final PCB:

 <br>
  <br> <center><img src="Project_pics/MPPT_Schametic_Numbering.png" width="900" height="600"/> </center>
  <br>

 <p align="justify" class="serif">
In above figure we have given numbering to the different portion of the schematic, it is explained below:<br><br>
<b>1- Microcontroller and its required components:</b><br>
	The microcontroller is the key component of this whole circuit as it is making decissions on the basis of values it is receiving.
the components attached with microcontroller in "1" are chosen according to the Arduino Leonardo which uses the same Microcontroller.
An ICSP header is also connected to burn the boadloader on to the microcontroller. The connection of a USB MINI are also made with the
microcontroller.<br><br>

<b>2- Input Voltage Divider Circuit:</b><br>
	This circuit divides the input voltage to such a level in which microcontroller can sense it because if we attach the microcontroller directly, it cannot
bear the voltage and will burnout intantly. So we have to reduce the voltage to such a level which can be given to microcontroller. We used a 39kiloohm resistor and a 10 kilo ohm resistor 
to make the ratio appropriate. Also two zener voltages are connected in parallel for we want input voltage not more than a certain value.
<br><br>
<b>3- Input Current Sense Amplifier:</b><br>
	INA213, a current sense amplifier is connected here to sense the input current. The shunt resistor helps this IC to sense the current and then this IC gives output to the Microcontroller which then displays 
it on the LCD.<br><br>

<b>4- Half Bridge Driver IC and Buck Converter:</b><br>
	The IR2104, a half bridge MOSFET driver takes input of PWM signal from the microcontroller and then performs the switching of the MOSFETs. Hence controlling the output current and voltage.
<br><br>
<b>5- Output Current Sense Amplifier:</b><br>
	It works on the same principle as the input current sense amplifier.
<br><br>	
<b>6- Output Voltage Regulator:</b><br>
	Volatge regulator is developed here for the same reason, the only difference is the voltage for division. Here the voltage is 12V. So, we connected a 22 kilo-ohm resistor in series with a 10 kilo-ohm resistor.
<br><br>
<b>7- LCD connectors:</b><br>
	these connectors are attached for the display which will be mounted on the casing.
	<br><br>
<b>8- Power Headers and Voltage Regulator:</b><br>
	The three headers for 12 volts Supply(on which the board will operate), Panel(to take input from solar panel) and Output(for the output voltage taken from the circuitry ).
The voltage regulator is connected because we are using 12V supply on which the IC IR2104 operates but all other ICs need 5V to operate so we are using this LM7805 for this purpose.

 <p align="justify" class="serif"> 	whille routing the PCB it consumed a lot of out time because the circuit we were following used a separate board for microcontroller
but our aim was to embed both the circuit on a single layer, making it more compact. This came with lots of hurdles while routing, we used few zero ohm resitor to overcome 
routing issues and at the end developed a lot more compact circuit after tens of attempts. </p>

  <center><h2 id="C1"><b>Challenges faced while coding</b><h2></center>
 <p align="justify" class="serif">The major problem we faced during the coding for this project was configuring the timer for generatng PWM signal. We tried to configure different available timers using different PWM pins on the board. First we configured timer1 using PWM pin 9, but this timer was a 16 bit timer which 
brought a lot of problems because our major calculations were based on the 8 bit timer. so after struggling a lot we obtained a maximum volatge of 7.44V at the output. Furthermore we connected
our Half bridge driver with PWM pin 11 and using timer0 we obtained the exact output.

 <p align="justify" class="serif">We used both processes i.e. 3D-printing as well as Laser cut. out main circuit containing part was made using 3D-printer but
 the top of the case was made using Acrylic sheet with laser cut. </p>

  <center><h2 id="C1"><b>Business model </b><h2></center>
 <p align="justify" class="serif"> Every product which needs to be in the market requires a good business plan. for our product, we considered few major point regarding its cost and its users.
As our project is user friendly in terms of its size, the size increases the durability. One can carry it anywhere to be used. Furthermore, solar charges(MPPT based) are very expensive 
products, we used such components which are commonly available and are cheap. With these two major advantages, we hope to cover a good number of users of our products when released in the market.

 <p align="justify" class="serif"> The project we have implemented was first designed by a hobiest "Lucas Fuslar", whose project have been chosen for Hackaday finals. He have done a lot of experiments over this project
We were following his lead majorly in this project. Our FabLab Assitants also were a source of great help when we had difficulty relating hardware. Our lab instructor Sir Aizaz Ali helped us dealeing with the code as well as routing of the PCB. Sir Nadir was a great source of help when we needed help in 
milling the PCB. Sir Azmat assited us while were designing the enclosure for our project. Without all of these, our succes in this project was difficult. </p>

  <center><h2 id="C1"><b>Conclusion</b><h2></center>
 <p align="justify" class="serif" >This project was full of learning. We had a lot of practical interaction with our theoratical knowledge. 
 This project proved a golden oppurtunity as we implemented most of our theoratical knowledge.
Creating an inductor, milling a PCB, designing an enclosure.etc. all of these experiences proved fruitful in increasing our skills 
and capabilty to do experiments and troubleshooting. In future, we have decided to continue such kind of practice
for further learning and skill development.</p>
